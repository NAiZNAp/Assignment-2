# Assignment-2

<h1>Assignment 2</h1>
This project I have chosen to do a weather application that will display the weather of any location the user enters. 
Github published link: 

<h2>Design process</h2>
Initially, I planned to have the app to be able to display multiple information including forecast and indices, however due to time limits and also I am unable to get the forecast part working, I decided to cut that part out to the current state.
